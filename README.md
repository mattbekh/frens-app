## Project Description

A social app for students to meet new people with similar interests. Will store user data (name, age, faculty, interests) along with "match" data keeping track of their matches on the app. Users will be able to input their interests and look through a list of other users who share similar interests and match with them. Some additional functionality would include the ability to chat and chat persistence, ability to send media (photos, videos, gif, etc) and "forgot password" option during login.

- Welcome page (animation), then display logo (at the top) and "login(goto Login page)" & "register(goto Register page)" button, transition between pages

  - Login page, with account name and password input

- Register page, form with input for username, password, email, choose 3 interests from 10
- Profile page (scrollable), user bio, profile picture, school and general account biography display info, pre-defined questions
- Main page, display the account information of user (name, picture) as header, updating "find friends" list with suggested friends

## Standard Requirements

- Account page, displays information about user account and ability to change bio/ photo/ etc
- Matches page, displays a page of current matches with clickable sections which display their accounts
- Password reset functionality for login page
- Add prompts which are displayed once you match with someone

## Stretch Requirements

- "Remember me" data persistence for the app
